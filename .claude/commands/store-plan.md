Store a plan record in the `plans/` folder.

Instructions:
1. Look at the recent conversation to identify the plan being discussed — its goals, approach, steps, and any trade-offs or open questions.
2. Create a new markdown file at `plans/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-kebab-case-title>.md` (using today's date) with this template:

```markdown
# Plan: <Title>

**Date:** <today's date>
**Status:** Draft | In Progress | Completed | Abandoned

## Goal

<What this plan aims to achieve — 1-2 sentences.>

## Approach

<High-level strategy or architecture decisions.>

## Steps

<Ordered list of implementation steps.>

## Open Questions

<Any unresolved questions or decisions that still need to be made. Remove this section if none.>
```

3. Confirm the file was created and show the path.

If the conversation doesn't contain a clear plan, ask the user what plan they'd like to record.
