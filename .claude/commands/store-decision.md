Store a decision record in the `decisions/` folder.

Instructions:
1. Look at the recent conversation to identify the decision being made, the options considered, and the reasoning.
2. Create a new markdown file at `decisions/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-kebab-case-title>.md` (using today's date) with this template:

```markdown
# Decision: <Title>

**Date:** <today's date>
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

<Why this decision was needed — 1-2 sentences.>

## Options Considered

<For each option, list pros and cons.>

## Decision

<Which option was chosen and a brief justification.>
```

4. Confirm the file was created and show the path.

If the conversation doesn't contain a clear decision, ask the user what decision they'd like to record.
