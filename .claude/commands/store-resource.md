Store a resource record in the `resources/` folder.

Resources are knowledge documents that explain concepts, patterns, or technologies relevant to the project. They serve as a reference for future development.

Instructions:

1. Look at the recent conversation to identify the topic or concept being explained.
2. Create a new markdown file at `resources/<YYYYMMDD>-<short-kebab-case-title>.md` (using today's date) with this template:

```markdown
# <Title>

<Clear explanation of the concept or topic. Include:
- What it is
- Why it matters for this project
- How it works (with code examples if applicable)
- Any gotchas or important details>

## References

<Links to official docs, articles, or project files that are relevant.>
```

3. The document should be self-contained and understandable without needing the original conversation context.
4. Confirm the file was created and show the path.

If the conversation doesn't contain a clear topic to document, ask the user what they'd like to record.
